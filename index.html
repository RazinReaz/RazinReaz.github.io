            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi everyone! I am Razin and I teach people Computer Science at the same university I graduated from! <br> 
                Yes, right now, I am an adjunct lecturer at the <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/">BUET</a>. 
                I completed my undergraduate degree in July 2024 with a <b>CGPA of 3.93/4.00</b>. Looks like all those sleepless nights paid off!
                <br><br>

                <!-- I am interested in everything related to Graphics, Visualization, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I plan to do research in these fields. 
                In my spare time, I build simulations and visualizations of things I find interesting. More about it in the <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> tab. -->
                <!-- <br><br> -->

                My research interests lies in <b>Computer Graphics</b>, <b>Visualization</b>, <b>Computer Vision</b>, and <b>Physically Based Rendering</b>.

                Ever since I started programming, I always get a kick out of turning every new thing I learn into code. 
                It's always fun watching my own little simulations in my computer screen. 
                LissaJous curves, fractals, Fourier series, you name it. 
                Helps me learn better too, as I am a visual learner. 
                <!-- Those are the reasons why I am interested in everything related to <b>Graphics</b> and <b>Visualization</b>.  -->
                You can take a look at some of my projects in the <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> tab.
                <br><br>

                I also have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Deep learning. 
                The fact that simple weight matrices can do wonders in recognizing patterns and learning features is mind-blowing!
                <!-- The first time I learned about GANs, I was blown away by the concept of fooling the discriminator while it gets better at distinguishing real from fake.  -->
                When I first learned about GANs, I was blown away by how they fool the discriminator while it gets better at spotting what's real and what's fake. 
                The intuition behind other models like VAEs, CNNs, LSTMs are also deeply fascinating! I am especiallly interested in
                explaining the inner workings of a machine learning model visually.<br>
                <!-- Right now, I am <b>learning Reinforcement Learning</b> to make my own autonomous agents. -->
                <br><br>
                A short overview of my <b><i>research experience</i></b>: I have experience building a deep learning model 
                to predict earthquake intensity with only 3 seconds of seismograms as my undergraduate thesis. 
                I also have experience collecting physiological data from more than 40 rickshaw-pullers 
                using more than 7 sensors to analyze the impacts of heat exposure on them. More about it in the <a href="./research.html">Research</a> tab.
