        <h2>Hi there! I am Razin!</h2>
        <p>
          I teach people Computer Science at the same university I graduated
          from! <br />
          Yes, right now, I am an adjunct lecturer at the
          <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/"
            >Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a
          >, <a href="https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/">BUET</a>. I completed my
          undergraduate degree in July 2024 with a <b>CGPA of 3.93/4.00</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research interests lies in <b>Computer Graphics</b>,
          <b>Visualization</b>, <b>Computer Vision</b>, and
          <b>Physically Based Rendering</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since I started programming, I always get a kick out of turning
          every new thing I learn into code. It's always fun watching my own
          little simulations in my computer screen. You can take a look at some
          of my projects in the <a href="./projects.html">Projects</a> tab.
        </p>

        <p>
          A short overview of my <b>research experience</b>: I have experience
          building a deep learning model to predict earthquake intensity with
          only 3 seconds of seismograms as my undergraduate thesis. I also have
          experience collecting physiological data from more than 40
          rickshaw-pullers using more than 7 sensors to analyze the impacts of
          heat exposure on them. More about it in the
          <a href="./research.html">Research</a> tab.
        </p>

        <!-- I also have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Deep learning.
                The fact that simple weight matrices can do wonders in recognizing patterns and learning features is mind-blowing!
                When I first learned about GANs, I was blown away by how they fool the discriminator while it gets better at spotting what's real and what's fake. 
                The intuition behind other models like VAEs, CNNs, LSTMs are also deeply fascinating! I am especiallly interested in
                explaining the inner workings of a machine learning model visually.
